# PowerPointLearning

**PowerPointLearning** is a tool made for mastering your skills in Microsoft PowerPoint. It generates random tasks from simple to very complex. This program was made for my personal use while I was preparing for the Microsoft Office World Compatition where I was compiting in MS PowerPoint 2016.

I was using this tool primarily for practicing my speed using every shorcut that is provided in PowerPoint. At the end of the day I won the 4th place at the World Compatition.
